## Hello,

You have stumbled across my first full scale project!
I've been using this game / library to teach myself coding!

[Languages Used in this Project]
- JavaScript
- HTML5
- CSS
- TypeScript
  
[Coming Soon -Non game features]
- A full start to finish tutorial on everything in this project from learning vairbles and functions, to es6 classes , and my as of right now crude understanding of async / await. (hopefully that will change from now till then.)
- Full Library Documentation on every function in the library as well as examples!
- Some tips on language specfic features for people just starting to learn.
Learn by making a simple game like brick breaker!
